Working with dates and time is one of the important skills for a data science engineer. Lot of the datasets which we get to work on will have date attribute. Lubridate package in R is really powerful and very easy to use. Mastering this package gives you the weapon which you can use to work with date and times with ease.

This is first blog on using lubridate package. We are going to learn most basic features which most of us use while working with date attributes.

I am going to use the Apple stock daily dataset for this blog. 


<br>

```{r}

apple <- read.csv("../../data/AAPL.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

```


<br>

If you try to plot of this stock prices using timeseries plot, it wont work because the column type of the 'Date' attribute is string/character. I have used the read.csv method to read the file. Using read_csv will not have this issue, I have purposefully use read.csv to show how to work with date column when it is a string.

Try plotting the Date column using highcharter, below is the plot you see. If you observe the x axis you see that every date is mentioned because they are treated as individual values of the series of date.

<br>

Now if you want to fix this plot, you have to convert this column into date type and then plot again.

<br>

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", preview=TRUE}

ggplot(apple, aes(as.Date(Date), Close)) +
  geom_line()

```


Let us say you want to view the volume of the stock on yearly basis, how would you do it? We have to separate the year from the date attribute. 

> Lubridate provides a function called "year" which helps us to pull the year value from the date attribute.


We are going to pull this and add as a new attribute to the dataset which then we will use it for plotting the yearly volume.

```{r}

apple$Year <- as.factor(year(apple$Date))

yearly <- apple %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(Total_Volume = sum(as.numeric(Volume)))

datatable(apple[1:100, c(1,5,7:8)])

```

<br>


```{r}

hchart(yearly, "bar", hcaes(Year, Total_Volume))

```


<br>

Now we have the year, let us pull out the month and day as well into separate columns.


> month() and day() allow us to pull the month and day values from dates respectively.

<br>


```{r}

apple <- apple %>%
  mutate(Day = day(Date),
         Month = month(Date))

datatable(apple[1:100, c(1,5,7:10)])

```


> It would be great if we can get the month names instead of the numbers, which is very easy by just passing in the label parameter to month().

<br>

```{r}

apple <- apple %>%
  mutate(Day = day(Date),
         Month = month(Date, label = TRUE))

datatable(apple[1:100, c(1,5,7:10)])

```


<br>

We will finish off this with plotting the volume based on the months.

<br>

```{r}

monthly <- apple %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(Total_Volume = sum(as.numeric(Volume)))

hchart(monthly, "bar", hcaes(Month, Total_Volume))

```

### Summary of what we learnt in this post

* Converting the strings into Date 
* Using Lubridate to get the year from Date column
* Using Lubridate to get the month and also month names from Date column
* Using Lubridate to get the day from Date column 
* I guess we did learn making few plots.
